# Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis and visualization of the ongoing pandemic and vaccination efforts around the world. Using a variety of charts and graphs, we showcase the vaccination rates among different countries, the impact of vaccination on hospital admissions, the rate at which vaccination was taken among different age groups, and the ranking of countries that have exceeded in taking vaccines. Additionally, we highlight the different types of vaccines administered in each country, providing a comprehensive overview of the global vaccination landscape. By visualizing this data, we hope to help people better understand the current state of the pandemic and vaccination efforts, ultimately aiding in the development of informed decisions and policies.
